# LeetCode Solutions 🧑‍💻

This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems. Please note that these solutions may not always be the most optimal or professional, as they reflect my personal approach to solving the tasks. I strive to improve my code and make it more efficient over time. 🚀

You can navigate to a single folder, where all the tasks are located in one file. Inside the file, you will find:

<br>

- **Task Description**: A brief explanation of the problem. 📄
- **Input and Output**: The format and expected results. 🔢
- **Solution**: My approach to solving the task. 💡

<br>

You can search for each task within the file to find its details. 🔍

<br>

I also explore algorithms that I encounter while solving tasks on LeetCode. For each algorithm, you can find detailed information in the **Algorithm** folder. The folder is organized into subfolders based on the algorithm type, and each subfolder contains:

- A file with task examples related to the algorithm. 📝
- An **MD file** providing detailed information about the algorithm, including how it works and when to use it. 📘
Additionally, I found information about each algorithm and the associated tasks from various online sources, which have helped me deepen my understanding of each concept.

I am constantly working on optimizing my solutions and learning new techniques. Feel free to explore the code and follow my progress! 📈
